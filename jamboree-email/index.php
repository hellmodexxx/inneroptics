			<h3>A better way of making websites</h3>
			<p>Our new content managed website system provides you with a whole host of features:
			<ul>
				<li>A selection of striking and contemporary templates in various colours;</li>
				<li>the ability to add, edit and delete web pages at your leisure without the added cost of a web designer;</li>
				<li>an easy to use &quot;Microsoft Word&quot; type interface;</li>
				<li>add, move and resize any images you wish;</li>
				<li>structure your website as you wish, nesting pages under other pages, the system makes your menu for you;</li>
				<li>comprehensive video tutorials and manuals.</li>
			</ul>
			Our demo will show you how to make your first three paged website in less than 3 minutes.</p>
		
			<h3>A cheaper way of making websites</h3>
			<p>All this does not have to be expensive:
			<ul>
				<li>There&acute;s a &pound;600 initial payment, with &pound;150 per year payments after the first year.</li>
				<li>No additional costs, we host the website, which means your total cost for running your website should not increase over your current hosted website.</li>
				<li>Free access to a selection of future upgrades we make to the system</li>
			</ul>
			If you would like a bespoke design or a specific feature we would be more than happy to draw up a quote for the work, almost anything is possible.</p>
